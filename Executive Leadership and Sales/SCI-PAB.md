SCI-PAB is a surefire method for figuring out what to say AND in what order to say it. Use it to achieve better results faster at the start of any presentation or meeting. It works even for the short conversations, voicemails, and emails that happen every day.

# Situation:
State what you know about your listener's circumstances that is relevant to the discussion, e.g., current state of business, technology, industry, plans. The facts in the Situation shouldn't be controversial or new to listeners. This is always the first sentence in your SCI-PAB. 
Ex. Your lead time for changes in configurator app is too long and releases cause incidents and costly rollbacks.

# Complication
Identify the critical issues (changes, pressures, demands, etc.) that are impacting the Situation and creating problems or opportunities. Often, the most effective Complication statement provides new, thought-provoking information. 
Ex. Configurator adoption is low, customers choose generic, low margin products

# Implication
Show the personal or business consequences of failing to act on the problems or opportunities described in the Complication. The Implication provides a logical transition and adds urgency to your recommendations.
Ex. You loose revenue

# Position
State clearly and confidently your opinion about what needs to be done to solve your listener's problem. Communicate this at a high level; this isn't the tactical Action step that follows, but rather a strategic statement about your point of view on the issue(s). Keep it short. 
Ex. Automate all your tests with CI. Execute them in full for every commit including feature branches. Provide all results at code review.

# Action
Help your listener understand the role you want them to play, or the questions you'd like them to consider, during your presentation or conversation. Use action words like consider, discuss, explore, and understand.
Ex. Schedule a workshop where we show you how to do it.

# Benefit
Describe how your recommended Position/Action will address listeners' needs. State the results clearly and quantifiable. The benefits you describe should differentiate you and be meaningful to your listeners. 
Ex. Get visibility on quality of each build. Eliminate waiting time and handovers. Reduce manual repetitive work and let your team focus on building better code faster
