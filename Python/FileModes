For opening files, there are three modes:

read-only mode (r)
write-only mode (w)
read–write mode (rw)
For opening a text file using the above modes, we will have to append ‘t’ with them as follows:

read-only mode (rt)
write-only mode (wt)
read–write mode (rwt)
Similarly, a binary file can be opened by appending ‘b’ with them as follows:

read-only mode (rb)
write-only mode (wb)
read–write mode (rwb)
To append the content in the files, we can use the append mode (a):

For text files, the mode would be ‘at’
For binary files, it would be ‘ab’
